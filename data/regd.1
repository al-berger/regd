.SH NAME
.PP
regd \- Registry daemon.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
regd <\fICOMMAND\fP> [\fIARGUMENTS\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBregd\fP is a server daemon program for storing or temporarily keeping
information in the form of name/value pairs (tokens) and returning it
in response to commands.

.PP
\fBregd\fP can run either as a network server on a dedicated IP address
or as a local server using a local file ("Unix file socket") as a server
address.

.PP
Once \fBregd\fP server is started it remains running and responds to commands
which are sent to it. Commands manage the server behaviour and are used
for adding information to the server storage, retrieving or deleting it,
restarting and stopping the server, getting reports, etc.

.PP
Commands can be sent to the running \fBregd\fP server in one of two ways:
via command line with another \fBregd\fP instance invoked as a client, or
via sockets, if the connection to \fBregd\fP server is made from another
or program.

.PP
Any user on a system can have a separate regd server running, containing
her own information. If needed, one user can have several regd server
instances running with different server names and different sets of information.
Each server instance has its own persistent and temporary storage and its
own permission access level.

.PP
Each regd server running on a file socket can have one of three permission
access levels for all its data: \fIprivate\fP, \fIpublic\-read\fP or \fIpublic\fP.

.SS File socket servers and Internet socket servers
.PP
\fBregd\fP server can be started either on a file ("UNIX domain") socket or
on Internet socket with an assigned IP address and port number. Any user on
a system can have multiple \fBregd\fP servers of both types simultaneously
running each with its own data storage. The main differences between file socket
servers and Internet socket servers are the following:
.IP \n+[step]

\item 
.PP
File socket server runs using a common file as its address and can only be
accessed by users who have access to the filesystem where the file socket is
located. Whereas Internet socket servers can be accessed from any computer, from
which the network address ofthe \fBregd\fP server can be reached.
\item 
.PP
File socket servers have access permission system which allows to restrict access
to data only to certain users accounts, and can be used for safely sharing private
data only between trusted users. Internet socket servers can only restrict data
access to certain IP addresses from which they accept commands.
.SS Starting regd server
.PP
When \fBregd\fP server is started (invoked with the \fB\-\-start\fP option),
it must be provided with four configuration options (all of them have
default values): server address, access level, server name and data file.

.PP
\fIServer\_address\fP

.PP
Server address is identifying information with which it can be contacted from
another process (or from command line).

.PP
If \fBregd\fP is started on an IP address,  the address must be specified with
\fB\-\-host\fP and \fB\-\-port\fP command line options (see below).

.PP
If \fBregd\fP is started on a file socket (which is default), its address is the
server name, specified on the command line (or the default name if the server
name wasn't sepecified). If a file socket server is contacted from another
user account, its address includes the user name of the server process owner
(the name of the account from which the server was started).

.PP
\fIServer\_name\fP

.PP
If one user has more than one \fBregd\fP server running on \fIfile\_sockets\fP, these
servers need to be distinguished via different server instance names. The server
name is assigned to a \fIregd\fP server instance on startup with \fB\-\-server\-name\fP
command line option. The server name can have length up to 32 characters. Names
must be unique within one user account. Different users can have identically
named \fIregd\fP servers.

.PP
If a user has only one \fBregd\fP server instance running on a file socket, then this
server may or may not be provided with a name (if no name is provided on startup,
the default name is used).

.PP
\fBregd\fP servers running on IP addresses don't have names and \fB\-\-server\-name\fP
option is ignored on their startup.

.PP
\fIAccess\_level\fP

.PP
A \fBregd\fP server running on a UNIX file socket has a permission level for accessing
and manipulating its data. A single permission level applies to all the data kept
in session and persistent tokens on the server. The \fBregd\fP permission control
distinguish two groups of users: \fIprivate\fP and \fIpublic\fP. The \fIprivate\fP group includes
the server user who started the server ("server process owner") and users listed in the
\fBtrusted\_users\fP option in \fIregd.conf\fP file ("trusted users"). The \fIpublic\fP group
includes all other users.

.PP
Secure tokens remain private at all permission levels (public permission levels don't
apply to secure tokens). Server's permission level is set on server startup with
\fB\-\-access\fP option and can be one of three values:
.IP \n+[step]

\item 
.PP
\fBprivate\fP : Only the server process owner and trusted users can send commands to the
server. All commands from other users are denied. This is the default level.
\item 
.PP
\fBpublic\-read\fP : The data on the server except of secure tokens is "world\-readable".
The server process owner and trusted users have full access to the server. From other
users the following commands are executed: \fB\-\-check\fP, \fB\-\-list\-all\fP, \fB\-\-list\-pers\fP,
\fB\-\-list\-sessions\fP, \fB\-\-get\fP, \fB\-\-get\-pers\fP. All other commands from other users
are denied.
\item 
.PP
\fBpublic\fP : The data on the server except of secure tokens is "world\-readable" and
"world\-writable". All users having access to the machine's filesystem can read, add,
modify and remove session and persistent tokens (secure tokens remain private and
can be accessed only by the server process owner and trusted users).
.PP
If \fB\-\-access\fP option is not present at server startup, then the server permission level
is set as 'private' by default.

.PP
The following commands can be executed only by the server process owner and trusted users
at all permission levels ("private commands"): \fB\-\-start\fP, \fB\-\-stop\fP, \fB\-\-restart\fP,
\fB\-\-add\-sec\fP, \fB\-\-get\-sec\fP, \fB\-\-load\-file\-sec\fP, \fB\-\-remove\-sec\fP, \fB\-\-remove\-section\-sec\fP,
\fB\-\-clear\-sec\fP, \fB\-\-report\-stat\fP, \fB\-\-show\-log\fP.

.PP
\fIData\_file\fP

.PP
Each server instance by default has its own persistent storage: data file from which
persistent tokens are read on startup and to which they are saved back when new tokens are
added, or existing tokens are modified or removed. The data file name can be provided
with \fB\-\-datafile\fP command line option on server startup. The default name of the data file
is used if \fB\-\-datafile\fP option is not present on startup and automatically composed out
of three parts:
.IP \(bu 2

\item Directory: the \fIregd\fP data directory defined in \fB'datadir'\fP option in \fIregd.conf\fP,
or default one if 'datadir' is not defined .
\item File: for file socket servers the server name is used as a data file name; for servers
on IP addresses the combination of host name and port number is used as.
\item Extension: ".data" file extension
.PP
The presistent storage can be disabled for a server by specifying "None" in the
\fB\-\-datafile\fP option on server startup. In this case the server will only work with
session tokens and commands relating to persistent tokens will be denied.

.SS Communicating with regd server
.PP
A running \fIregd\fP server keeps listening for incoming commands on the address on
which it has been started (file socket or IP address). To communicate with a server
either the socket/IP address can be used directly from other programs or \fIregd\fP itself
can be called in client mode to send a command to a \fIregd\fP server.

.PP
To send a command to a \fIregd\fP server, \fIregd\fP in the client mode is invoked with
following general syntax (items in square brackets are optional):

.PP
\fBregd\fP [<\fI\-\-host\fP> <\fI\-\-port\fP> | <\fI\-\-server\-name\fP>] [\fI\-\-log\-level\fP] \fIcommand\fP

.PP
A server running on an IP address must always be contacted with the \fB\-\-host\fP
and \fB\-\-port\fP present on the command line:

.PP
$ regd \-\-host some.hostname \-\-port NNNN \-\-get "someItem"

.PP
A server running on a UNIX file socket must be contacted through it's server name
(if it was started with a \fB\-\-server\-name\fP option) and with the username of the
server process owner if the server was started by a user other than the user
sending it a command. User name is prefixed to the server name with '@' symbol:

.PP
alice@servername

.PP
If the server was started without server name, then only the user name with '@' must be
used as the server address. For example, if a server was started by user 'alice' without
the server name, as follows:

.PP
$ regd \-\-start \-\-access public\-read

.PP
then user 'alice' can contact the server as follows:

.PP
$ regd \-\-add someItem=someValue

.PP
User 'bob' can contact this server as follows:

.PP
$ regd \-\-server\-name alice@ \-\-get someItem

.PP
If the server was started by user 'alice' with the name 'info':

.PP
$ regd \-\- start \-\-server\-name info \-\-access public\-read

.PP
then user 'alice' can contact the server as follows:

.PP
$ regd \-\-server\-name info \-\-add someItem=someInfo

.PP
and user 'bob' can contact the server as follows:

.PP
$ regd \-\-server\-name alice@info \-\-get someItem

.SS Tokens
.PP
In \fBregd\fP documentation the term \fItoken\fP designates the basic unit
of information storage. A token consists of a token identifier (\fIname\fP)
and data (\fIvalue\fP), which is associated with this name. Both name and
value are Unicode strings and can hold arbitrary Unicode values of
arbitrary length. (However, see the NOTES section below about
special cases when a token contains '=', '\\' or ':' characters.)
The token name is used as as the token identifier.

.PP
Tokens are grouped in sections. Token name can contain an
optional section name, which is the part of the name up to the
first colon. E.g.:
"SECTION NAME : token name".
If the section name is not present in the token name, the token
is stored in the section named 'general'. If the section name contains
colons within itself, they must be prepended with backslashes.

.PP
A token can be one of two types regarding its lifetime:
\fIsession\fP token or \fIpersistent\fP token. Session tokens
exist in the registry from the moment of their addition
until the program's exit or until their removal with a command.
Persistent tokens are automatically stored in a disk file, automatically
loaded to the registry on each program start and exist until
they are explicitly removed with a removal command.

.SS Secure tokens
.PP
Secure tokens are the tokens that have certain access restrictions and security
enhancements in their processing:
.IP \n+[step]

\item 
.PP
in file socket servers they are never shared to public and remain private (
accessible only by the server owner and trusted users) even in servers with
'public' and 'public\-read' access.
\item 
.PP
they always have session lifetime and never stored to disk and they are discarded
from the RAM when the server is stopped or when they are removed with a removal
command. Also secure tokens are not included in the print output of listing commands.
\item 
.PP
they can automatically be loaded from an encrypted file or from other secure
source. with secure loading command: \fB\-\-load\-file\-sec\fP . This command by default
is meant to call 'gpg' encryption program, which reads an encrypted file with secure
tokens, prompting the user for the password if needed, and then pipes the file text
to the \fBregd\fP through a shell pipe. A user can use any other command of loading
secure tokens as long as it returns the list of "name=value" pairs through a shell
pipe.
.SH COMMANDS
.SS Help and version
.SS \-\-help
.PP
Display short command summary.

.SS \-\-version
.PP
Display the program version.

.SS Starting, stopping, checking a server
.SS \-\-start
.PP
Start \fBregd\fP. This command can be used with command line options: \fB\-\-host\fP, \fB\-\-port\fP, \fB\-\-user\fP, \fB\-\-log\-level\fP (see below). To start \fBregd\fP on an Internet address, the command line options \fB\-\-host\fP and \fB\-\-port\fP must contain the host name and port number of that address. If "\-\-host" and "\-\-port" are not specified, \fBregd\fP will run on a Unix file socket as a local daemon.

.SS \-\-stop
.PP
Stop \fBregd\fP. All session tokens are discarded.

.SS \-\-restart
.PP
Restart \fBregd\fP. All session tokens are discarded.

.SS \-\-check
.PP
Check if the \fBregd\fP is running.

.SS Adding tokens to the server
.SS \-\-add <\fIname=value\fP>
.PP
Add a session token. If a token with such name already exists, the token value is not updated.

.SS \-\-set <\fIname=value\fP>
.PP
Add a session token. If a token with such name already exists, the token value is updated.

.SS \-\-add\-pers <\fIname=value\fP>
.PP
Same as \fB\-\-add\fP, but the token is added to the persistent tokens.

.SS \-\-set\-pers <\fIname=value\fP>
.PP
Same as \fB\-\-set\fP, but the token is added to the persistent tokens.

.SS \-\-load <\fIname1=value1\fP>[\fIname2=value2\fP...]
.PP
Add multiple session tokens. Each name/value pair must be separated from the previous one with the token separator. The default token separator is a three\-character sequence: \fI@#$\fP . With this default separator multiple tokens are specified like this:
.br
"name1=value1@#$name2=value2"
.br
The value of the token separator can be customized in \fIregd.conf\fP file.

.SS \-\-load\-pers <\fIname1=value1\fP>[\fIname2=value2\fP...]
.PP
Same as \fB\-\-load\fP, but adds persistent tokens, rather
than session ones.

.SS \-\-load\-file <\fIfilename\fP>
.PP
Add session tokens from a file. \fIfilename\fP \- the path
of the file with tokens. The file must contain "name=value"
pairs with one pair per line.

.SS \-\-load\-file\-pers <\fIfilename\fP>
.PP
Same as \fB\-\-load\-file\fP, but adds persistent tokens, rather
than session ones.

.SS \-\-load\-file\-sec [\fIfilename\fP]
.PP
Add secure tokens from an encrypted file. \fIfilename\fP \- the
path of the file with secure tokens. \fIfilename\fP can be
ommited, in which case the default encrypted file will be
read. The default name of the default file is:
\fI\~/.sec/safestor.gpg\fP
The name of the default encrypted file can be specified in
\fIregd.conf\fP.
The default command for reading encrypted files is:

.PP
"gpg \-\-textmode \-d FILENAME"

.PP
For this default command could be used, \fIgpg\fP, \fIgpg\-agent\fP
and \fIpinentry\fP programs needs to be installed and run on the
computer. With this command, when the first command during a
program session for getting a value of a secure token
('\-\-get\-sec') is received, a \fIpinentry\fP dialog window is
shown to the user, prompting for entering the password.
If the password is correct, \fIgpg\fP program then reads the
contents of the encrypted file and pipes the file text to
the \fBregd\fP, where it's kept in RAM.
With this procedure the decrypted file contents are never written
toa disk and always remain in RAM.

.PP
The command for reading encrypted files can be changed and
specified in the \fIregd.conf\fP.

.PP
Display some statistics about this server.

.SS \-\-show\-log 
.PP

.SH COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
.PP
All \fIregd\fP command line options can be used both when starting a server as well as when
invoking regd as a client (for sending commands to the running server).

.SS \-\-log\-level <\fIlog\_level\fP>
.PP
This command line start option sets the level of the log
output. Log level can be one of the following values:
DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL.
Log level is the type of events which which cause the
program to produce output. Can be used

.SS \-\-server\-name <\fIserver\_name\fP>
.PP
This option applies only to file socket servers. For servers running on an IP address
it is ignored.
\fIServer mode\fP : When starting a server on a file socket, this option assigns server the name
which will be used for sending it commands and distinguishing it from other servers of the
same user. When starting the first file socket server instance, the server name is optional
(if it is omitted, the default name is used). When starting second and following instances, the
server name is mandatory.
.br
The server name must be unique within one user account. Different users on one machine
can have identically named servers.
.br
The server name can have length up to 32 characters.
.br
\fIClient mode\fP : When contacting to a running server, the server name must be specified on the
command line in following cases:
\- the server command is sent from a guest user (that is from a user account other than the
server process owner account). In this case the server name must be prefixed with the server
process owner username and '@' character.
\- the server was explicitly assigned a name on startup. In this case the server owner must
contact the server using the assigned server name. Guest users must use the prefixed server
name, described in the previous section.

.PP
If a server was started without server name, the guest users must use just the username of the
server owner with '@' appended as the server name.
Examples:


.SH User alice starts two servers: one with the default name

.SH and one with a custom name
.PP
$ regd \-\-start \-\-access public\-read
$ regd \-\-start \-\-server\-name info \-\-access public\-read


.SH User alice contacts both servers: without the server

.SH name specified, the default name is used
.PP
$ regd \-\-add "item1=value1"
$ regd \-\-server\-name info \-\-add "item2=value2"


.SH User bob contacts these servers:
.PP
$ regd \-\-server\-name alice@ \-\-get item1
$ regd \-\-server\-name alice@info \-\-get item2

.SS \-\-host
.PP
This option applies only to servers running on IP addresses.
.br
When starting a server on an IP address, this option specifies the name of the host to
which the server must be bound:

.PP
regd \-\-start \-\-host some.hostname \-\-port NNNN

.PP
In client mode this option specifies the name of the host where the
server to which the command must be sent is running:

.PP
regd \-\-host some.host \-\-port NNNN \-\-get "someInfo"

.SS \-\-port
.PP
This option applies only to servers running on IP addresses.
.br
When starting a server on an IP address, this option specifies the port number on
which the server must be listening.

.PP
In client mode this option specifies the port where the server to which the command
must be sent is listening.

.SS \-\-datafile
.PP
The full pathname of the file from which the server instance will read persistent tokens
and to which they will be stored. If this option is not present in command line, the server
is started using the default file name in the directory specified in \fIdatadir\fP option in
\fIregd.conf\fP. If \fI\-\-datafile\fP option has the value \fINone\fP, then persistent tokens will not
be supported by the server instance: all commands relating to persistent tokens will fail.

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
.PP
The configuration file \fIregd.conf\fP is read on the program
startup. Options in \fIregd.conf\fP residing in \fI/etc/regd/\fP
are system\-wide ( applied for all users using \fBregd\fP ). The
system\-wide options can be overriden in a user\-level
\fIregd.conf\fP located in \fI\~/.config/regd/\fP directory.

.PP
Options that can be set in \fIregd.conf\fP are described in
\fI/etc/regd/conf.regd\fP file.

.SH NOTES
.PP
If a token contains any of the following three characters: '\\', ':' or '=',
then certain rules must be observed because colon in \fIregd\fP is used as the
section name separator, equals sign is used as the name/value separator and
backslash is a special system character.

.PP
1) If the section contains ':' characters, each of these characters must be
prepended with '\\' (backslash) character (prepending a character with backslash
is called 'escaping' character).

.PP
2) If the name contains '=' characters, each of these characters
must be escaped.

.PP
3) If a token (the section or name or value ) contain backslashes, they
must be prepended with another backslash.

.PP
4) If the section or name ends with backslash, then the separator (colon or equals
sign) that follows after it, must be prepended with space.

.PP
E.g., if a token has a section "C:\\", name "TEMP\\a=b.txt" and value "D:\\temp\\a=b.txt",
then when adding this token to \fIregd\fP in the "section:name=value" form,
it must be modified as follows:

.PP
regd \-\-add "C:\\ :TEMP\\a\\=b.txt = D:\\temp\\a=b.txt"

.PP
That is, colons must be escaped only in sections, equals signs must be escaped only in
names, and backslashes must be escaped everywhere. And if a section or name ends with
backslash, it must be followed by space.
